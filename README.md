# ChangeLog

## 2025/04/08 - version: 0.01.00+02

This commit introduces significant enhancements to the user authentication and local database management logic. It includes the implementation of a new local authentication repository, refactors user-related operations, improves serialization formats, adds validations, and introduces comprehensive test coverage.

### Changes made:

1. **lib/data/repositories/auth/auth_repository.dart**:
   - Added a `user` getter to expose the currently signed-in user.
   - Replaced the `signUp` method with a more flexible `addUser` method that accepts a `User` object.

2. **lib/data/repositories/auth/local_auth_repository.dart**:
   - Created a new implementation `LocalAuthRepository` for local user authentication using `JsonDatabaseService`.
   - Implemented `signIn`, `signOut`, `changePassword`, and `addUser` methods with internal user state handling and error management.

3. **lib/data/services/json_database_service.dart**:
   - Enhanced `open()` method with safe initialization and admin user fallback creation.
   - Replaced `signIn` return type to return `User?` instead of throwing on error.
   - Replaced `_findUser` with `_findUserByName` to improve clarity.
   - Updated `addUser` method with robust validation for permissions, duplication, and role-based constraints.
   - Implemented `removeUser` and `updateUser` methods for local user account management with permission checks.
   - Improved collection methods (`insertIntoCollection`, `removeFromCollection`, `updateInCollection`) to return `bool` or `String?` instead of throwing, with improved error handling and logging.
   - Adjusted internal user serialization to use `millisecondsSinceEpoch` for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

4. **lib/domain/models/butcher_shop.dart**:
   - Refactored `toMap` and `fromMap` methods to serialize/deserialize `createdAt` and `updatedAt` using `millisecondsSinceEpoch` for consistency and compatibility with JSON.

5. **lib/domain/models/user.dart**:
   - Made `createdAt` optional in constructor with default value as `DateTime.now()`.
   - Updated `toMap` and `fromMap` methods to use `millisecondsSinceEpoch` for timestamp fields to standardize JSON compatibility.

6. **lib/utils/validate.dart**:
   - Added detailed documentation for all validation methods.
   - Introduced validation logic for `password` and `confirmPassword` with error message returns.

7. **test/data/services/json_database_service_test.dart**:
   - Added a comprehensive suite of tests for `JsonDatabaseService` covering:
     - Open and close behavior
     - Admin sign in/out logic
     - Add, update, and remove users under different permission levels (admin, manager, employee)
     - Full CRUD testing of collection-based operations

8. **test/widget_test.dart**:
   - Deleted default widget test as it is no longer relevant to current application logic.

9. **coverage/lcov.info**:
   - Added code coverage report file generated by test runs.

### Conclusion:

These changes establish a robust foundation for user account management with proper validation, permissions, and comprehensive testing. The new local authentication system enhances modularity and testability, paving the way for scalable authentication workflows.


## 2025/04/08 - version: 0.01.00+01

    ### Changes made:
    
    1. **Makefile**:
       - Added targets for common git operations (`diff`, `push`, `push_branch`), Flutter rebuild, and test coverage.
    
    2. **lib/data/repositories/addresses/address_repository.dart**:
       - Added `addresses` and `addressList` getters to provide local access to address data.
    
    3. **lib/data/repositories/addresses/local_address_repository.dart**:
       - Replaced `AppConstants` with `Collections` enum for better consistency.
       - Refactored to use `addressCollection` constant.
       - Implemented the new `addresses` and `addressList` getters.
    
    4. **lib/data/repositories/auth/auth_repository.dart**:
       - Created new abstract `AuthRepository` with methods for sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and password change.
    
    5. **lib/data/repositories/butcher_shop/butcher_shop_repository.dart**:
       - Added `butcher` getter for accessing local butcher shop data.
    
    6. **lib/data/repositories/butcher_shop/local_butcher_shop_repository.dart**:
       - Replaced `AppConstants` with `Collections` enum.
       - Added `butcherCollection` constant.
       - Refactored CRUD operations to use the enum-based collection name.
    
    7. **lib/data/repositories/common/app_constats.dart**:
       - Deleted legacy file with hardcoded collection constants.
    
    8. **lib/data/repositories/common/collections.dart**:
       - Created `Collections` enum to centralize and type-safe collection names.
    
    9. **lib/data/services/json_database_service.dart**:
       - Refactored all methods to use the `Collections` enum.
       - Added `loggedUser` getter with masked password.
       - Implemented `signIn`, `signOut`, and `signUp` user authentication methods.
       - Added internal `_findUser` method to locate users by name.
       - Added user auto-creation on database initialization (admin).
       - Increased UID generation size from 12 to 32 characters.
    
    10. **lib/domain/enums/enums.dart**:
        - Added `Positions` enum with labels to define user roles.
    
    11. **lib/domain/models/user.dart**:
        - Created `User` model with serialization, deserialization, and utility methods.
    
    12. **lib/main.dart**:
        - Refactored imports to a cleaner format.
        - Updated JSON database import path to `json_database_service.dart`.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    This commit introduces a foundational user authentication system, transitioning to a more structured approach using enums for collections and user roles. It also enhances repository interfaces and brings consistency across the database service through refactoring and better design principles.
