### Enhance Address and User Form Usability with Layout and Behavior Updates

This commit improves form input usability and layout consistency across the address and user editing interfaces. It includes enhancements for responsive design, form interaction constraints (like `readOnly` fields), and layout alignment for better UX across screen sizes.

### Modified Files

- **lib/ui/core/themes/dimens.dart**
  - Adjusted `desktop` layout values:
    - Changed `paddingScreenAll` from shared `Dimens.paddingAll` to fixed `15.0`.
    - Reduced `paddingScreenHorizontal` from `100.0` to `25.0` for better usability on wider screens.

- **lib/ui/core/ui/text_fields/basic_text_field.dart**
  - Added a `readOnly` parameter to allow non-editable text fields.
  - Passed the `readOnly` flag to the `TextFormField` widget.

- **lib/ui/features/address/address_page.dart**
  - Triggered a `setState()` call after address initialization to ensure form fields are updated visually when loading existing address data.

- **lib/ui/features/edit_user/edit_user_page.dart**
  - Marked the address field as `readOnly` to prevent manual editing; navigation to a specific form page is now required for updates.
  - Refactored the layout for "Contato" and "Documento" fields into a horizontal row using `Expanded`, enhancing UI consistency and readability.
  - Called `setState()` after loading and populating the address data to ensure immediate UI refresh.

### Conclus√£o

These adjustments significantly improve form behavior, visual consistency, and user interaction flow, particularly on desktop screens or wider mobile devices. The changes ensure data is correctly displayed and edited only through designated workflows.

  - Added `callBack` and `addressId` parameters.
  - Implemented `_initializeAddress()` to pre-fill form fields for editing.
  - Updated `_onSaved()` to invoke the callback with the saved address object.

- **lib/ui/features/address/address_view_model.dart**
  - Added `_getAddress()` method and related `Command1` to retrieve address by ID.
  - Updated state to store and expose the current address instance.

- **lib/ui/features/edit_user/edit_user_page.dart**
  - Updated to store and manage `addressId`.
  - Calls the address page with current `addressId` and a callback.
  - Receives the updated address and updates the UI accordingly.

- **lib/ui/features/edit_user/edit_view_model.dart**
  - Added `getAddress()` method to fetch address data.
  - Stores and exposes the current address instance for UI consumption.

### Deleted Files
- **storage/data.json**
  - Removed old mock data as persistent storage is now ignored via `.gitignore`.

### Conclusion
The app now supports full address editing and integrates a structured callback system to return data between views, enhancing the modularity and user flow for address management.

   - Adjusted internal user serialization to use `millisecondsSinceEpoch` for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

4. **lib/domain/models/butcher_shop.dart**:
   - Refactored `toMap` and `fromMap` methods to serialize/deserialize `createdAt` and `updatedAt` using `millisecondsSinceEpoch` for consistency and compatibility with JSON.

5. **lib/domain/models/user.dart**:

     - Full CRUD testing of collection-based operations

8. **test/widget_test.dart**:
   - Deleted default widget test as it is no longer relevant to current application logic.

9. **coverage/lcov.info**:
